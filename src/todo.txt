//figure out how to trigger re-render of twitter widget**


1. On hover render that ward's polygon a different color on the map
	//attach hover event ("onMouseEnter") to each card component 
	//dispatch an event that updates "currentCardHover" value 
	//connect the Map component to store OR pass down prop from App.js which is already connected 
	//

2. Using the browsers location determine which ward the user is currently in + place a marker there 
	//get position of user when app mounts + save in store
	//pull in position to Map component and render a <Marker> component with the position 
	//output a sentence with current ward info
		- to find current ward will need to somehow filter through all the different polygon components and determine if marker position is inside 

3. Add a modal to compare data for two wards
	//add a form to the ward.js component with a drop down menu of all the wards
	//create a Modal component that pops up when form is submitted that renders vitals components for each ward selected
